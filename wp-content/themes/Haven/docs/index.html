<h2><a name="sec1_2">1.2</a> Installing Your Theme</h2>
<br/>
Once you have downloaded the haven package from Themeforest.net, there are 2 ways of installing this theme. These are as follows:<br/>
<br>
<b>METHOD 1</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Unzip the download package using Winzip or equivalent.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You will see another zip archive file inside called <b>haven.theme.zip</b>, unzip this file also using Winzip or equivalent software and using an FTP client (eg. Filezilla), upload its contents to your WordPress installation. You will need to place the folder into the following location:  <i>wp-content/themes</i>
	</li>
	<li>Now inside your WordPress admin area, go to <i>Appearance &gt; Themes</i> and there you will see the haven Theme.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click <i>Activate</i> to activate the theme. If you do not see the theme in this screen, you have done something incorrectly. Review the last few steps again.</li>
</ol>
<b>METHOD 2</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Unzip the haven download package. Once unzipped you will see a zip file named <b>haven.theme.zip</b>, this is a compressed version of the theme.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now inside your Wordpress admin area, go to <i>Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Install Themes (tab) &gt; Upload</i>
	</li>
	<li>Click browse and locate this <b>haven.theme.zip</b> file and upload it<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now you will see the haven theme in the <i>Manage Themes</i> tab.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click <i>Activate</i> to activate the theme. If you do not see the theme in this screen, you have done something incorrectly. Review the last few steps again.</li>
</ol>
<b>Installation Video</b>
<br/>
Here is a link to an video showing the installation of the theme and the importing of demo content: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heHlFAb0x_4" rel="nofollow">INSTALLATION VIDEO</a><div class="note"><b>Congratulations you have now successfully installed the haven Theme</b></div>
<h2><a name="sec1_3">1.3</a> Theme Installation Errors</h2>
<br/>
<div class="alert">Do not upload the Themeforest download package directly to your Wordpress site, because this will lead to errors. Make sure to Unzip this package and inside you will find the theme zip archive: <b>haven.theme.zip</b>. This is what you will need to upload to your Wordpress installation</div>
<br/>
<b>If you upload / Install the haven theme and you get one of the following errors, then you have forgotten to unzip the download package.</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>This theme is invalid<br/>
	</li>
	<li>This theme is missing a style.css</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec2_0">2</a> Theme Setup<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>Before you start using the haven theme, a few setup steps are required. This section will walk you through these steps.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec2_1">2.1</a> Importing Demo Content</h2>
<br/>
Some buyers like to install their theme and have it look exactly like the Themeforest preview site. If this is something you would like to do, then follow the steps in this section. This step is optional so feel free to skip it. The subsequent sections will provide all the instructions you need to insert your own content manually.<div class="note">The dummy content inserted in this step will not contain the beautiful images seen in the Themeforest.net demo. These images cannot be included because they are commercial images, which we have purchased for theme demonstration only and we do not have a redistribution license for these assets.</div><b>To Import Demo Content</b><div class="note">Make sure to install and activate the haven theme before importing any demo content.</div><img src="shots/Import Demo Content.png" alt="[Import%20Demo%20Content.png]" title="" /> 
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Install and activate the haven theme. (See section above)<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Go to the haven theme options <i>Appearance &gt; Theme Options</i>
	</li>
	<li>The <b>General</b> tab should be open by default, but if not click it to show the general options.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The very first section in the <b>General</b> is the demo Content import section.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click the large green <i>Import Demo Content</i> button once only.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The theme will now import our demo content into you site. A progress bar will inform you of the import processes progress.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>This importer will basically import posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, sidebars, widgets, menus and all configuration from our preview content export file.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">Please note that dummy images will be used instead of the premium image assets we have used in our online preview.</div><div class="alert"><b>Alert 2</b> If you already have content in your site, you will be asked to confirm the import, but if your site is a fresh installation of Wordpress, there will be no confirmation request. Importing demo content will not overwrite existing content such as posts or pages, but it will replace all sidebar and widget configuration. So please be aware of this before you decide to do this process.</div>
<h1><a name="sec3_0">3</a> Theme Structure - How It Works<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The haven theme is essentially a single page theme with a separate blog section. The single page layout is made up of a master page and multiple subpages. These sub pages make up the sub sections of the single page layout, sections like services, portfolio, clients etc. Sub sections are basically accessed via main navigation and they will appear in whatever order you choose. To construct this site structure you need to follow these steps:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Create a Master Page using the &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Header&quot; page template. (See &quot;Creating Pages&quot; section for more info.)<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Next create a separate page for each of the sub sections you would like to insert on the one page layout.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the &quot;Page Attributes&quot; box on the right hand side of the &quot;Edit Page&quot; admin you will assign the master page you created in step 1 as the parent of each of these sub pages. To do this simply select the &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Header&quot; page from the dropdown list available under Parent field.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Next you will need to specify the order in which these sub pages will appear. This can be done in the same box using the &quot;Order&quot; field. Enter 1 or 2 or 3... etc. in here for each of your desired sub pages. This will dictate the sequence in which the sections appear in the one page setup, when scrolling down.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Next you just need to tell WordPress to use your master page as the opening page of your website, to do this go to &quot;Settings &gt; Reading&quot; in the WP admin and set your master page as the &quot;Front Page&quot; (Static) in the option entitled &quot;Front Page Displays&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now your website will open with your master page and if you scroll down or use the main menu, you will see all of your sub pages in the order which you set in step 4 above. These new sections will be displayed without a full page reload.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">The Blog page (plus optionally any other pages you would like) is an exception to this structure, it must be attached as a separate page only and may not be a child or sub-page of the homepage section. This means that a reload is needed when switching to the blog section. The Blog section is created like a normal page (Using the blog page template) and is simply linked via the main menu. (See the &quot;Menu&quot; section for more info about this.</div>
<h1><a name="sec4_0">4</a> Retina Support<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The haven theme contains optional support for devices with a retina display. This support may be enabled/disabled via the theme options ( Appearance&gt;Theme Options&gt;Advanced Tab&gt;Retina Support&gt; Yes/No).<br/>
<br>
What retina support really means is that the theme will serve hi-res version of content images to decide which have a retina display. This is done automatically for all content used in the theme except for one place; The site logo.<br/>
<br>
<b>Creating a Retina Site Logo</b>
<br/>
If retain support is enabled, a high resolution version of the site logo is required. The theme will not automatically create this, it must be done manually. See the instructions below:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Using image editing software, you will need to create a version of your logo image which is 2 times the size of your original logo. For example is your original logo is 100x50px, the retina logo will need to be 200x100px.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>When creating this retina logo, there is a rule about how the retina logo has to be named. The file name must be exactly the same as the original image but with a suffix of <b>@2x</b>, added just before the file type.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>For example, say your original image is called <b>logo.jpg</b>, therefore the retina image file name would be <b>logo@2x.jpg</b>.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Upload both the normal logo image and the 2x logo image at the same time to your WP theme insert the original logo image into the logo option in the theme options and the theme will automatically take care of the rest.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec5_0">5</a> Custom Thumb Cropping<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1><img src="shots/thumbnail.crop.png" alt="[thumbnail.crop.png]" title="" />
<br/>
The haven theme contains a custom thumbnail cropping feature. This feature is most useful if you want to control how your large images are cropped when they are for example shown in your portfolio grid. With this feature you can control exactly how the thumbnails are created from your larger images.<br/>
To use this feature go to: <b>Media &gt; Library</b> in the main WordPress menu. Now select any image from the library, an image used in your projects would be most suitable. On the main attachment page, scroll down until you see the dialog box entitled: &quot;Thumbnails&quot;. To define a custom crop for a thumbnail, do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>This dialog will contain all of the thumbnail version of this attachment which have been auto-generated by the theme for use in those areas you have inserted this image. If this image features in many areas of the theme, or has done at some stage, but was replaced, this dialog may contain numerous thumbnails. 
	</li>
	<li>Find the thumbnail which corresponds with the size of the thumbnail in your portfolio page (which you wish to re-crop). You may need to check the size of that image in your portfolio grid page. You can do this with an element inspector which is built into most modern browsers. Use it by right clicking once you are hovering the image, then select &quot;Inspect Element&quot; from the context menu. Now you should be able to find the image size in the panels which appear.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Once you have found the thumb you are looking for, click it in the dialog. This will open the thumb cropping control, hiding all other thumbs in the process.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>With your mouse you can now resize and reposition the cropping frame in the window on the left. Once the position has changed you will see a preview of the resulting thumbnail in the window on the right.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>When you have found a suitable crop for this thumbnail, click the &quot;Save&quot; button. The crop control will close and the other thumbs will reappear. 
	</li>
	<li>Now refresh your portfolio grid page to view the updated thumbnail. Remember to clear your browser cache, otherwise the updated thumbnail may not appear.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">Once thumb cropping has been altered, the browser cache should be cleared before viewing the page which contains the updated thumbnail.</div>
<h1><a name="sec6_0">6</a> Creating Posts<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The haven theme contains 3 different post formats - Standard, Video and Gallery. 
<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec6_1">6.1</a> Custom Metaboxes</h2>
<br/>
haven supports several post formats, some of them like <i>Video</i> or <i>Gallery</i> require additional configuration parameters which can be set in the Metabox Area, under the post/page content editor. Each time a Post Format is selected, the page updates and only the Metaboxes relevant to the current selections will be shown.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec6_2">6.2</a> Post Format: Standard</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts an optional featured image. To insert this featured image do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>In the Featured Image box, click <i>Set featured Image</i>
	</li>
	<li>This will open the WP media loader. Select the image you wish to use for the featured image. The resolution should be large, minimum of 1000px wide and the pixelentity framework will auto-generate the size required for the post. ( The image should be optimized for web and devices and should have a file size generally less that 300kb. The smaller the file size the better, as long as the image quality is not compromised. )<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Once the image is loaded ensure the <i>original size</i> is selected and click the <i>Set as Featured Image</i> button.<br/>
	</li>
	<li> Close the media uploader window and publish your post.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec6_3">6.3</a> Post Format: Video</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts a custom video post type as its media content. To insert this video do the following:<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Scroll down the page to the <i>Video Options</i> Metabox. There you will find a drop menu containing the list of all the custom video post types which have been created.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the video you wish to feature in this post.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You can also add a featured image to this post. If one is added it will become the cover image for the video item. If no featured image is entered, the video item will attempt to load its default cover image generated by YouTube or Vimeo, depending on which service you are using. 
	</li>
	<li> Now publish the post.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">It should be noted that if  you are using the auto cover image fetching method. The theme will only be able to fetch this image is the original video uploader has permitted it. This is usually permitted by default except for videos marked &quot;private&quot;. If the video is private, no image will be loaded.</div><div class="alert">In order for a video to appear in the list, it first needs to be created. See the section on <b>Creating A Video</b> for more information.</div>
<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec6_4">6.4</a> Post Format: Gallery</h2>
<br/>
This format accepts a custom gallery post type as its media content. To insert this gallery do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Scroll down the page to the <i>Gallery</i> box. There you will find a drop menu containing the list of all the custom gallery post types which have been created.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the gallery you wish to feature in this post.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Underneath the list of galleries you can specify the width and height of the desired gallery. These values may mean that your images will be cropped in order to achieve the entered dimensions. The extend of the cropping depends on the image&#39;s original aspect ratio. To avoid cropping of the images leave these fields blank and the gallery will be sized to fit its content / container.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert">In order for a gallery to appear in the list, it first needs to be created. See the section on <b>Creating A Gallery</b> for more information.</div><div class="note">In this theme all gallery posts will display their content as a slider.</div>
<h1><a name="sec7_0">7</a> Creating a Gallery<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The haven theme features a Gallery custom post type. This can be found in the main WP admin menu <i>Galleries</i>. All gallery type posts and portfolio items will need to have their gallery content created first using this custom post type. Once it has been created here it will be available to be inserted into those areas.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec7_1">7.1</a> Direct Upload Gallery</h2>
<br/>
This type of gallery is most suited for when the images you want to display are not already uploaded to your Wordpress installation, it will present you with a big &quot;Drop Files Here&quot; area into which you can just drag and drop images from your hard drive. The gallery will take care of everything and, once the upload process is done, you can just save/publish. The image order can be manually altered by dragging thumbs to suit your needs.<br/>
<br>
<b>To create a Direct Upload Gallery do the following:</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Select the <i>Galleries</i> item in the main admin menu &amp; select &quot;Add New&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>In the <i>Gallery</i>box, select &quot;Direct upload&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Drag and drop your images into the <i>Upload Gallery Images</i> section&#39;s drop zone with the dashed outline.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>These images will now load and appear below the drop zone in the <i>Gallery Content</i> area as thumbnails.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may drag these thumbnails to reorganize the sequence of images if this is important.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>You may also add an optional featured image to the gallery post. This will be used as the cover for the gallery post in certain configurations.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now click <i>Publish</i> to publish this gallery post. This type of post is mostly used to provide content for another post or portfolio project. The post may also be viewed in it&#39;s own page however by clicking the <i>View Post</i> button.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec7_2">7.2</a> Gallery Image Display Options</h2>
<br/>
The haven theme contains one single display option - Slider.<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li><b>Slider:</b> The content of the gallery will be displayed as slider. There are no additional options for this mode.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec7_3">7.3</a> Media Tags</h2>
<br/>
The WordPress media library doesn&#39;t allow you to categorize attachments/images in any way besides the upload date. For this reason, in our framework, we have introduced a feature called &quot;Media Tags&quot;. Media Tags work exactly like regular &quot;Tags&quot; do for posts: each image can be assigned one or more tags which can then be used to group similar/related images.The media library admin page has been expanded to allow easy media tags management and image filter by tag.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec7_4">7.4</a> Media Tags Gallery</h2>
<br/>
When Wordpress media library is already filled with some images, you can categorize them by using media tags. Once you have created one or more media tags, you can use them to create a gallery. Unlike the direct upload case, the gallery will now show a list of all existing media tags: by selecting one (or more) tag from the list (and clicking the refresh button), all the images assigned to those tag will be automatically added to the gallery. Since the same tags can be used in multiple galleries, you don&#39;t need to upload the same image multiple times in order for it to appear in different places. Whenever you assign additional images to a media tag, every galleries making use of these tags will also update its content automatically.<br/>

There is nothing we can do about this unfortunately because problems arise when Envato change something in their API but do not immediately update their class. Therefore if this method of updating does not work for you, there is always the manual way.  </div>

<h2><a name="sec14_3">14.3</a> Placing Your widgetized Area Into The Theme</h2>
<br/>
Once you have filled your widget area with your desired widgets, you will still need to tell the theme on which posts you would like to display this widget area. To do this see the following:<br/>
<br>
<b>To Insert The Widget Area as a Sidebar:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>On some pages you will see on the right hand side below the &quot;tags&quot; box, an additional content boxes entitled <b>Sidebar</b>.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>This boxes allow you to select which widget area is to be used specifically on that post for the sidebar. This may be different for each and every page template. Some templates do not support sidebars, in this case no sidebar selection box will appear on that page.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec15_0">15</a> The Main Menu<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The haven theme contains 1 menu locations, the <b>Main Menu</b>. This menu does not support any sub levels of menu items. In this section we will outline the steps involved in creating the menu for this theme.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec15_1">15.1</a> Creating A Menu</h2><div class="note">Before you create your menu for this theme, make sure your pages/sections have been created already. This way they will be available to be inserted into the menu and their parent/child dependencies will be saved also.</div><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Go to Appearance&gt; Menus in the main admin menu.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>At first you will probably need to add a menu, give it a name &amp; click <i>Create Menu</i>. The new menu will appear in a tab in this location. Click on this tab to begin adding menu items.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Use the dialog boxes on the left hand side of the page to add items to your menu. Select the master page you created as well as all of the sub sections or child pages and click &quot;Add to Menu&quot;.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Now you can drag the newly inserted menu item to their correct sequence and rename their titles if required. 
	</li>
	<li>After you have added and edited the menu items click <i>Save Menu</i> in the bottom of this area.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">If you have imported demo content supplied with this theme, then this menu will already be made however it will still need to be saved again before working correctly, to do this click &quot;Save Menu&quot;.</div>
<h2><a name="sec15_2">15.2</a> Adding The Menu To the Theme</h2>
<br/>
Finally you will need to specify the location for this menu. As mentioned above, the haven theme contains 1 possible menu location; the Main Menu.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<b>To assign the Main Menu</b>
<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Go to Appearance&gt; Menus in the main admin menu.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>At the top left of that page you will see a panel titled <i>Theme Locations</i>
	</li>
	<li>Here there will be a select box under the two available locations in the haven theme.These select boxes will hold a list of all created menus.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>so select the menu you wish to place in the Main Menu location from the drop down and then click <i>Save</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="sec16_0">16</a> Shortcodes<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>This theme contains several useful shortcodes. These are basically helper codes which can be inserted into the default Wordpress editor and when the page is rendered they will become full elements. The type of element depends on the type of shortcode used. Shortcodes are available for inserting videos and sliders, columns, accordions, icons and services. In this section we will list these available shortcodes and the properties or parameters associated with each one. 
<br/>
To insert a shortcode simply click the <i>Insert Shortcode</i> button in the toolbar area of the default Wordpress editor.<br/>

To be inserted correctly each shortcode needs to be inserted using the shortcode editor. If this process is not followed, the page will not render correctly and the layout will not look as expected.</div><b>To Add a Shortcode do the following:</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Position the cursor in the editor in the specific position where you wish to place the shortcode or element.<br/>

</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec18_0">18</a> Theme Translation<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>The only method to translate this theme is Using a POT file.<br/>
<br>
A POT file is a simple method but it is designed to basically translate the theme&#39;s static text content into one other language. For example this would be used when the theme was designed to be used in English, but your website will be in Italian or another language, and you would like to translate all the parts of the theme which are not the content you will be writing. This would included back end translation such as admin field names, descriptions etc, as well as front end static text which is visible to the visitor. These front end items would included things like contact from field names, comment section titles, other titles which appear automatically rather then being actually entered by you. This method is not designed to handle language switching in your website. If you require this more advanced functionality, you will need to use a plugin. No specific plugins have been tested with this theme, and hence we cannot guarantee that they will work.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<h2><a name="sec18_1">18.1</a> Translation Using POT File</h2>
<br/>
To translate the theme using the POT file do the following:<br/>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Create a po file for your language, for example <b>de_DE.po</b>
	</li>
	<li>Copy all text from provided theme pot file into your po file<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Edit the po file with <b>poedit</b> <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poedit.net/</a>
	</li>
	<li>Create the mo file<br/>
	</li>
	<li>edit <i>wp-config.php</i> file in your installation and set <b>WPLANG</b> so it matches your languages: <b>define(&#39;WPLANG&#39;, &#39;de_DE&#39;);</b>
	</li>
	<li>The Theme should now display all messages in your language.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert"><b>BACKUP YOUR LANGUAGE PO/MO FILES</b> 
Upon theme update, language files are <b>NOT</b> preserved. 
You will need to manually restore your po/mo files right after the update.</div>
<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<br>
<h2><a name="sec18_2">18.2</a> Modifying The theme&#39;s CSS</h2>
<br/>
The Custom CSS field provided in the haven theme&#39;s theme options panel should be used for making changes to the theme&#39;s CSS styles. This can be found in <i>Appearance&gt;Theme Options&gt;General&gt;Custom CSS</i>.<br/>
<br>
<br/>
<b>To overwrite an elements CSS styles:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Locate the element&#39;s CSS selector using firebug or chrome&#39;s element inspector.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Copy this selector and paste it into the Custom CSS Field found in the theme&#39;s custom options &quot;General&quot; tab.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Add your new styles and you are done.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click Save All Changes at the bottom of the theme options page.<br/>
		<br/>
		Now the theme&#39;s default CSS will be overwritten by what you have entered into the Custom CSS box.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h1><a name="sec19_0">19</a> Javascript<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>
<h2><a name="sec19_1">19.1</a> Adding Custom Javascript</h2>
<br/>
Similar to the Custom CSS filed in the theme options, there is also a Custom Javascript field to be used when you wish to insert additional javascript into the theme. The only difference with this field is that the javascript code placed here will not overwrite any existing javascript code. An example of custom javascript code which would be used in this field is Google Analytics. Simply paste in the javascript code provided by Google in this box, save and you&#39;re done.<br/>
<h1><a name="sec20_0">20</a> Rebranding the Custom Admin Panel<a class="top" href="#toc">top</a></h1>As many of our buyers are buying our themes in order to sell to their clients, we have decided to aid this process by designing our theme&#39;s custom admin panel to be easily rebranded. Our theme&#39;s custom options panel contains a secret option which allows our buyers to rebrand the admin panel with their logo and and afterwards these options disappear. This allows our buyers who provide their clients with themes which strengthen their brand identity with their clients and which don&#39;t force cross links to the pixelentity brand.<br/>
<br>
<img src="shots/branding.jpg" alt="[branding.jpg]" title="" data-spots="1:100:290,2:206:429,3:520:295,4:520:464" />
<br/>
<b>To rebrand the admin panel do the following:</b>
<br/>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
	<li>Navigate to the theme options page. <i>Appearance &gt; Theme Options</i> <div class="hotspot-link">1</div>
	</li>
	<li>In the browser address bar, add the following query string to the end of the existing url and hit enter.<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nt">branding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">1</span>
		</pre></div>
	</li>
	<li>A new tab will appear in the Theme Options page named <i>Branding</i> <div class="hotspot-link">2</div> The contents of this tab is shown in the above screenshot.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Here <div class="hotspot-link">3</div> you can set an image to be used as the logo/ branding for the custom admin panel. You can also set a custom url which will be attached to the logo image.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>To see the changes, click save <div class="hotspot-link">4</div> remove the query string from the url and reload the page.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The branding tab should now be hidden again and the new logo visible.</li>
